# Hummer - ME 495 - Artifical Life

## Description

- The work carried out here is part of the Artificial Life course taught by[Professor Sam Kriegman](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/kriegman-sam.html) at *Northwestern University*. 

- The first portion of the course follows the open *LUDOBOTS* course (hence the name of the repository) found on Reddit [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ludobots/).

- As a part of Ludobots, the [pyrosim github repository](https://github.com/jbongard/pyrosim) was forked and edited as necessary.

- The Ludobots portion of the course concluded with with creation of a quadruped. Following that, were my personal creations - the Catching Crab, and the Random Snake (which will eventually conclude in a final project, but is a necessary milestone).


## Random Snake... but in 3D

- For the *Random Snake*, the links and joints are created as follows -->

*Process shown in 2D, but carried out in 3D*

The following are randomly selected:
1. The number of links in the body
2. The size of each link
3. The face which the next link will attach to
4. The joint orientation between links
5. Whether a link is a sensor (green) or not (blue)

- To run the Random Snake:
    - Download the repository
    - Be sure to include all files that contain randomSnake______.py
    - Run **randomSnakeGO.py** to create the random body and begin the simulation
    - Note that the behavior itself is not yet evolved, so it will just spit out a random body and wiggle around!

- You can see the full videos **with music** here [(random snake)](https://youtu.be/kGDtNsKyQPk) and here [(random snake in 3D)](https://youtu.be/jUNL5z_xI_Q)


## The Catching Crab

- To run the Catching Crab:
    - Download the repository
    - Be sure to include Crab__.obj file in order to load the proper body geometry
    - Run **search.py** to begin the simulations
    - The population and generation sizes can be controlled by changing the parameters found in constants.py

- To the full video of the [unevolved](https://youtube.com/shorts/8TvGTw90hCs?feature=share) and [evolved](https://youtube.com/shorts/6lEWiCWt05M?feature=share) catching crab **with music**, go to my youtube channel at the links above.
    - I apologize in advance for the poor video quality!
