# Hummer - ME 495 - Artifical Life

## Description

- The work carried out here is part of the Artificial Life course taught by[Professor Sam Kriegman](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/kriegman-sam.html) at *Northwestern University*. 

- The first portion of the course follows the open *LUDOBOTS* course (hence the name of the repository) found on Reddit [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ludobots/).

- As a part of Ludobots, the [pyrosim github repository](https://github.com/jbongard/pyrosim) was forked and edited as necessary.

- The Ludobots portion of the course concluded with with creation of a quadruped. Following that, were my personal creations - the Catching Crab, and the Random Snake (which will eventually conclude in a final project, but is a necessary milestone).


## The Catching Crab

- To run the Catching Crab:
    - Download the repository
    - Be sure to include Crab__.obj file in order to load the proper body geometry
    - Run **search.py** to begin the simulations
    - The population and generation sizes can be controlled by changing the parameters found in constants.py

- To the full video of the [unevolved](https://youtube.com/shorts/8TvGTw90hCs?feature=share) and [evolved](https://youtube.com/shorts/6lEWiCWt05M?feature=share) catching crab **with music**, go to my youtube channel at the links above.
    - I apologize in advance for the poor video quality!


## Random Snake

- To run the Random Snake:
    - Download the repository
    - Be sure to include all files that contain randomSnake______.py
    - Run **randomSnakeGO.py** to create the random body and begin the simulation
    - Note that the behavior itself is not yet evolved, so it will just spit out a random body and wiggle around!

- You can see the full video **with music** [here](https://youtu.be/kGDtNsKyQPk)
